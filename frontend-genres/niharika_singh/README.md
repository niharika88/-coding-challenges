Change Log
============

Added angular view to fetch all the genres from genre.json and populate the genre list.

Enable user to save the genres .

Genres once saved (added/ removed) will be persisted.

Utilised Local Storage to achieve persistence.

Made api call to ficticious api via http service in angular.

Application Start
===================
npm install          (for  install all projet related dependencies)

npm install bower

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`. After that, you should find out that you have
two new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the Angular framework files



npm start (for SERVER start)

Server will start in       `localhost:8000/index.html`

Directory Structure
=======================
```
app/                    --> all of the source files for the application
  app.css               --> default stylesheet
  components/           --> all app specific modules
    version/              --> version related components
      version.js                 --> version module declaration and basic "version" value service
      version_test.js            --> "version" value service tests
      version-directive.js       --> custom directive that returns the current app version
      version-directive_test.js  --> version directive tests
      interpolate-filter.js      --> custom interpolation filter
      interpolate-filter_test.js --> interpolate filter tests
  view1/                --> the view1 view template and logic
    view1.html            --> the partial template
    view1.js              --> the controller logic
    view1_test.js         --> tests of the controller
  app.js                --> main application module
  index.html            --> app layout file (the main html template file of the app)
  index-async.html      --> just like index.html, but loads js files asynchronously
karma.conf.js         --> config file for running unit tests with Karma
e2e-tests/            --> end-to-end tests
  protractor-conf.js    --> Protractor config file
  scenarios.js          --> end-to-end scenarios to be run by Protractor
```
Unit Test
===========

To run the unit test use:

```
npm test
```

This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. Moreover, Karma will start
watching the source and test files for changes and then re-run the tests whenever any of them
changes.
